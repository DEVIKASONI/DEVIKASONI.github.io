        <h1> Welcome to my Horizon, I'm <br> DEVIKA SONI </h1>  
        <p>Let me initiate and ignite you folks, I'm an aspiring software currently in the 3rd major, hailing from Amity university. In other words, I belong to the technological world as a software developer. Am largely inclined by the fact that growth and development is the highest calling of leadership. The zeal and zest in me to craft the technologies of the threshold of the 3rd millenium and the previously known technologies to refine and renew them so as to cater the needs of the mankind or the industry. It has been a part of my big term plan ever since the epilouge or perhaps the prolouge. To enlighten and venture with the provided electic wholesomeness and experiential experience with my enhanced range of communication and influencing skills with the tip of the iceberg to loop and whoop to my network. The aspiration and inclination to testify, challenge and yearning to do better into practicality into actuality in confrey to day to day lifestyle track. I fully intend to divulge myself for the opportunity.
